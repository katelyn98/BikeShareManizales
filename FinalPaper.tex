\subsubsection*{Adults' Perspectives on the Current Bike Sharing System in Manizales, Colombia}
\end{center}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
Cities are getting bigger and computers are getting faster, and yet the skies are full of air pollution. But, economies are booming and the collaboration between citizens is resulting in life-changing technology that fosters on-demand, instant gratification characteristics. Such technology can prolong life and destroy boredom, but it can also be used to mitigate the impacts of climate change and augment outdated systems, such as a city's transportation system. The design of such a system, from its infrastructure to its user interactions, is imperative for a society to thrive. In hopes to amplify any given system in a city, technology and infrastructure are meticulously coalesced resulting in what researchers hope will produce a safer, reliable, and sustainable system. This combination of technology and infrastructure is highlighted in the definition of a smart city. (\cite{montoya2017acceso}). To clarify, by definition a city only needs to have one of the components that make up a smart city to be labeled as a smart city (\cite{montoya2017acceso}). 

 Transportation within a city is vital and significantly impacts the economy and quality of life (\cite{dávalos_maldonado_polit_2016}, \cite{zuluaga_garcía_2017}). A city and its metropolitan area, or outskirts, need to have a strong transportation system to successfully and reliably transport copious amounts of workers to and from "downtown" everyday; this means a transportation system needs to be designed to manage anywhere between less than 100,000 people to 1 million people or more everyday. Historically, cities are known for large highways with up to twelve lanes and very dense, complex road networks to mitigate traffic jams. However, Braess's Paradox validates how the creation of these dense road networks are actually making the traffic worse (\cite{wikipedia_2020}). In fact, Deliotte reported in their \textit{Smart Mobility Research Report} that, "The average American spends about 34 hours every year sitting in traffic" (pg. 2 \cite{DeliotteReport}). Clearly, the traditional cityscape fosters a system built to prioritize personal motor vehicles. The presence of cars in cities has lead to a crucial decline in sustainability including an increase in carbon emission, an increase in traffic jams, and an inefficient use of land which all negatively impact a citizen's quality of life (\cite{dávalos_maldonado_polit_2016}). Only recently have these inefficiencies been taken seriously. Consequently, urban planners, researchers, and entrepreneurs are rapidly prototyping new transportation systems in hopes to foster a smart transportation system while addressing issues related to traffic congestion, efficiency, and environmental impact. Evidently, the combination of technologies and transportation systems is enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of operations in cities and increasing the overall quality of life.  (\cite{montoya2017acceso}, \cite{dávalos_maldonado_polit_2016}).

Alternative approaches to the traditional transportation system aims to, "...reduce congestion and foster faster, greener, and cheaper transportation options" while enhancing the quality of life of the community (\cite{DeliotteReport}). These alternative approaches are multifaceted from the design of streets to the types of modes of transportation offered which includes ride sharing systems, bicycle commuting, car sharing, and on-demand ride services (pg. 4 \cite{DeliotteReport}). Three of those four presented alternative modes of transportation to traditional transportation involves cars. Very few of these cars are environmentally friendly, and unfortunately the exorbitant cost of environmentally friendly cars hinder a majority of car owners from investing in them. Only one alternative approach aims to improve the transportation system without the use of carbon emitting vehicles: bicycle commuting. 

The main objective is not to totally eliminate motor vehicles. In fact, that would be taking our society back to pre-automobile times...which also is not good for efficiency or an economy. To successfully transform urban mobility in a city to a multi-modal, sustainable system will take time. One of the goals of this process includes converting citizens who \textit{could} bike to work to do so instead of driving a car. Asking everyone to own a bicycle seems unlikely; but, in 1995 a group of urban mobility enthusiasts in Amsterdam created the first public bike sharing system (\cite{zuluaga_garcía_2017}). Since then, bicycle commuting and bike sharing programs have been popping up around the world, with a high volume in Europe and cities that tend to have overall flat terrain (\cite{DeliotteReport}). Some cities however are struggling with integrating the system into their current transportation system, especially cities in developing countries and cities with rugged terrain featuring steep hills and bluffs (\cite{zuluaga_garcía_2017}). As a matter of fact, developing countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, didn't start operating a public bike sharing system until after 2008 (\cite{midgley_2011}).

\subsubsection*{Statement of Purpose}
The objective behind this study is to better understand how adults in Manizales, Colombia view the current bike sharing system offered by .
This study attempts to determine which certain factors such as safety, efficiency, and reliability,
the people of Manizales consider when assessing the quality of the current bike sharing system. Additionally, this study seeks to identify how individuals predict
possible improvements relating to infrastructure, technology, and safety to the current bike sharing system might 
impact their use and view of this bike sharing system in the future.
\subsubsection*{Research Question}
Which certain factors such as safety, efficiency, and reliability influence how 
adults view and assess the current bike sharing system, CityBioBike, in Manizales, Colombia? 
How do they perceive potential improvements relating to infrastructure, technology, and safety
to the current bike sharing system impacting their use and view of CityBioBike in the future?

\subsubsection*{Sub-problems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do current users view the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the current bike sharing infrastructure and initiatives?
    \item To what extent does the safety of the current bike sharing infrastructure and initiatives negatively influence how an
    individual views and assesses it?
    \item To what extent does the efficiency of the current bike sharing infrastructure negatively influence how an
    individual views and assess it?
    \item To what extent does the reliability of the current bike sharing infrastructure negatively influence how an
    individual views and assess it?
    \item What factors are most valued when an individual evaluates the potential benefit of future improvements to the bike sharing system?

\subsubsection*{Literature Review}
Urban planners are constantly deriving and evaluating new strategies to satisfy desires for futuristic and sustainable 
transportation systems. Some of the most successful transportation initiatives are emerging from wealthy and developed 
European cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Stockholm \cite{DeliotteReport}. \textbf{Give more history on the start of the bike sharing system and its culture}. Culture and infrastructure around transportation 
within these European cities set the status quo for biking to be a reliable mode of transportation \cite{DeliotteReport}.  A common characteristic 
that distinguishes cities with sustainable transportation systems is their initiatives to grow as a smart city that 
fosters sustainable development. A smart city is composed of several components, attributes, and themes; this research study 
specifically focuses on the transportation component of a smart city, also known as smart transportation \cite{DefiningSmartCity}. 
Smart transportation, or smart mobility, in the context of this research study will be defined as transportation that is offered on demand
and is presented as efficient, sustainable, flexible, and eco-friendly \cite{SmartTransportation}. 

The transition from a traditional transportation system in a city that priortizes cars to a multifaceted, technology-enhanced transportation system
can be understood through the notion of socio-technical systems \cite{SmartTransportation}. Socio-technical systems are systems comprised of hardware, software,
data, laws, and citizens \cite{GeeksForGeeks}.

\subsubsection*{Barriers and Their Imapcts on Demand}
\textit{why the number of users in Manizales is only approximately 0.02\% of the population (\cite{CityBioBike}).}
Improving transportation systems’ design and infrastructure can lead to be an 
overwhelming task accompanied with an exorbitant cost but in the long run the benefits will distinctly present themselves. 
Smart transportation initiatives specifically relating to biking and bike sharing systems are growing rapidly within
cities. Some cities, as Deliotte points out, are lacking in infrastructure to foster a well-established commuter population comprised of 
bikers \cite{DeliotteReport}. Deliotte acknowledges from a study they did on smart mobility across cities in the United States that, “Slightly 
more than a quarter of current commuters could switch to biking as one of their main modes of commuting if barriers 
to biking were substantially reduced” \cite{DeliotteReport}. These barriers mentioned signifcantly affect the use and demand of a bike sharing system in any given city and 
there are several variables that contribute to this \cite{ReviewonBike-sharing}. Certain variables such as slope and elevation related to topograpy and the city's built environment
highlight unique trends amongst the individuals that use the bike sharing system. For example, open data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center
highlights that users of the bike sharing system in Pittsburgh, PA, USA tend to rent bikes from stations at higher elevations and end at lower elevations \cite{HealthyRidePGHPSG}. Evidently,
every city's landscape and built environment is unique, but the design and implementation of the bike sharing system seems to remain homogenous. This specific research seeks to identify the views
of the bike sharing system in Manizales, Colombia. By understanding how citizens assess and view the 
safety and quality of their city's bike sharing system, urban planners will be able to better design a system that is a safe, efficient, and reliable.

\subsubsection*{Manizales, Colombia \& Its Current Transportation Landscape}
Manizales, Colombia is the capital of the department Caldas in Colombia with a population of 400,436 people in 2018 with
71\% of the population being between 15 and 64 years old \cite{CalidaddeVida}. The city of Manizales is topographically very mountainous
naturally presenting barriers that need to be considered when planning for a successful smart mobility presence. To provide a strong case
to implement smart mobility in Manizales, Colombia, it is necessary to understand these barriers and the current transportation cutlure. In 2018, it was 
recorded that there was 445 vehicles per 1000 people which is equivalent of saying that there was one vehicle per every two people \cite{CalidaddeVida}.
Despite the report of 445 vehicles per 1000 people, another model shows that 56\% of the population's main mode of transportation is by bus \cite{CalidaddeVida}. 
This model however points out the only 12\% of the population reported their main mode of transportation to be walking or biking. To summarize here, the primary modes
of transporation offered in Manizales, Colombia include public buses, personal vehicles, bicycles, walking, taxis, or the Cable Aereo which is similar to a sky lift \cite{CalidaddeVida}.

\subsubsection*{Sustainability \& Mobility}
Ever since the United Nations released the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) for the world, countries have been consistently integrating
these goals into initiatives and projects within their cities. Manizales has been working on 
smart mobility initiatives for a few years now, but only recently have they been making significant progress. Their projects and initiatives for smart mobility 
are targeted towards advancing eleven of the seventeen SDGs \cite{OficinaDeLaBici}. The bike sharing system in Manizales, Colombia is particularly interesting 
because a company called CityBioBike has developed a biometric loaning system for bike renting \cite{CityBioBike}. CityBioBike partners with the Bike Office at 
the Universidad Católica de Manizales to provide a bike sharing system to the city \cite{OficinaDeLaBiciHome}.
