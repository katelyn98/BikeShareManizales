\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Statement of Purpose}
The objective behind this study is to better understand how adults in Manizales, Colombia view the current bike sharing system, CityBioBike.
This study attempts to determine which certain factors such as safety, efficiency, and reliability,
the people of Manizales consider when assessing the quality of the current bike sharing system. Additionally, this study seeks to identify how individuals predict
possible improvements relating to infrastructure, technology, and safety to the current bike sharing system might 
impact their use and view of this bike sharing system in the future.
\subsection*{Research Question}
Which certain factors such as safety, efficiency, and reliability influence how 
adults view and assess the current bike sharing system, CityBioBike, in Manizales, Colombia? 
How do they perceive potential improvements relating to infrastructure, technology, and safety
to the current bike sharing system impacting their use and view of CityBioBike in the future?

\subsection*{Subproblems}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How do current users view the safety, efficiency, and reliability of the current bike sharing infrastructure and initiatives?
    \item To what extent does the safety of the current bike sharing infrastructure and initiatives negatively influence how an
    individual views and assesses it?
    \item To what extent does the efficiency of the current bike sharing infrastructure negatively influence how an
    individual views and assess it?
    \item To what extent does the reliability of the current bike sharing infrastructure negatively influence how an
    individual views and assess it?
    \item What factors are most valued when an individual evalutes the potential benefit of future improvements to the bike sharing system?
\end{enumerate}
